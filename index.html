        This is a website about the sport of baseball. If you want to learn more about baseball, well, you are in the right place. (You are also in the right place if you don't want to learn more about baseball but are obligated to grade this assignment). This site will include copius amounts of information about the sport of baseball, including information about what you need to play, key information like what the <a class="link" href="./keyInfoPage.html"> rules</a> are and a small explanation of the game's <a class="link" href="./keyInfoPage.html"> history,</a> as well as a list of the places where the game is played <a class="link" href="./professionalBaseball.html"> professionally.</a>  As a brief synopsis (although you probably know what baseball is, I will explain it just in case), baseball is a sport where one team attempts to score runs, or points, whereas the other team tries to prevent the other team from scoring runs. You try to score runs by hitting a baseball (seen above) thrown by the other team with a baseball bat and then touching all four of the bases placed in a diamond on the field. You prevent the other team from scoring runs by getting them out three times, where you can get out by being tagged with the ball while not touching a base, having a member of the run preventing team tag the first base while holding the ball before the person attempting to hit the ball touches the first base, catching the ball in the air after it is hit without it touching the ground, or by having the person trying to hit the ball attempt to hit it, or swing in baseball parlance, and fail to hit it three times. Each team gets nine attempts to do each task, and whoever has more runs at the end of those nine attempts wins the game.

	<h3 class="subheader"> What You Need to Play Baseball </h3>
	<p class="mainText"> The main things that you need to play baseball are at least 17 friends, so you can have 9 players per team, and then a baseball bat, 18 baseball gloves (an example of both pictured left), and a baseball (example pictured above). Any landmarks around you can serve as bases. I personally have used things like lampposts, sweatshirts, trees, dirtpiles, street curbs, and bushes. You don't even necessarily need 18 people. Various different versions of baseball, such as wiffleball, can be played with as little as two people, depending on how creative you get with the rules, and how you use the landmarks around you.
