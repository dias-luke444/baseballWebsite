      <h2 class="subheader"> The Rules </h2>
      <p class="mainText"> There is not enough space in this section to describe all of the many, complicated rules of baseball. Instead, I will outline the key ones that you absolutely need to know to understand what is happening. If you want to read about all of the rules of baseball, you can read MLB's official <a class="link" href="https://mktg.mlbstatic.com/mlb/official-information/2025-official-baseball-rules.pdf">rulebook.</a> As mentioned in the introduction, each team gets nine attempts to both score and prevent runs, with one full round of attempting to score and prevent runs being called an inning and there are three outs for each team in each inning. Each team has nine active players at any one time, either trying to prevent runs, also known as fielding, or while attempting to score runs, also known as hitting. When hitting, there is an order at which you hit that loops over and over. An example order would look as follows: </p> <ol class="mainText"> <li> John Doe </li> <li> James Snow </li> <li> Jamie Throw </li> <li> Joe Know </li> <li> Jacob Flow </li> <li> Jeff Toe </li> <li> Jean-Jaques Stowe </li> <li> Johannes Show </li> <li> Jesus Lowe </li> </ol> 
    <p class="mainText"> When hitting, you get three attempts to try to hit the ball, called strikes. If you fail to hit the ball in those three attempts, you get three strikes, and thus have struckout, meaning that you are out. However, if it is deemed that the ball thrown to you by the other team is not properly hittable, it is called a ball. If you collect four balls, you get to advance to first base. You also get to advance to first base if you are hit by the ball. It is determined whether a ball was hittable or not, and thus if it was a strike or a ball, by the referee stationed behind the plate, called an umpire. There is an established zone of where balls are traditionally seen as hittable called a strike zone, and if a ball passes through that zone and is not hit, it is called a strike. It is also called a strike if the pitch was not in that hittable zone, but the hitter attempted to hit it, or swung the bat in baseball parlance, anyway. This strike zone is determined by the size of the hitter, and is supposed to be static, but, in reality, actually depends on who the umpire is, and how reliable they are. When the ball is hit, it is considered in play, as long as it stays within the lines of the field. If it is within the lines of the field, the batter becomes a runner and must make it to first base before the fielding team has a player tag the base while holding the ball. If the hitter fails, they are out. The hitter can choose to try and get to second, third or home base if they wish, but if they are tagged with the ball while not touching a base while trying to do so, they are out. The two exceptions to this rule are if the ball is caught by the fielding team without it hitting the ground, in which case the hitter is automatically out, or if the ball is hit over the fence, in which case the hitter is allowed to touch all four bases and score a run for free, in an act that is called a home run. </p>

    <article> <h2 class="subheader"> Origin of Baseball </h2>
    <p class="mainText"> Baseball was invented in England, as a modification of other different bat-to-ball games like stoolball and rounders. The classical story is that the game first approached its modern incarnation when <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Cartwright"> Alexander Cartwright</a> introduced the "Knickerbocker Rules" in 1845, which quickly spread around New York and later the rest of the US. This was such a common sentiment that Cartwright was elected into the sport's Hall of Fame, with things he invented ensrcibed on the plaque. However, recent investigations into the topic, including by MLB's official historian <a class="link" href="https://sabr.org/authors/john-thorn/"> John Thorn,</a> have revealed that Cartwright's Knickerbocker rules were merely an aggregation of previously invented rules, most of which were actually designed by <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wheaton"> William Wheaton,</a> one of Cartwright's contemporaries. There is no true "inventor of baseball", as the game developed iteratively over time, developing gradually from those aforementioned bat-to-ball games to the fully fledged sport we see today. More about the history of modern baseball, including its various different variants and myths, can be read <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_baseball#:~:text=The%20history%20of%20baseball%20can%20be%20broken%20down,being%20played%20in%20England%20by%20the%20mid-18th%20century."> here.</a> A description of the various ways baseball is currently played professionally can be found <a class="link" href="..\dias-html-assignment2\professionalBaseball.html"> here.</a> </p>
